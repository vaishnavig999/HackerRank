# Task 
# Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the
# percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

# Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

# Input Format

# There are 3 lines of numeric input: 
# The first line has a double, mealCost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). 
# The second line has an integer, tipPercent (the percentage of mealCost being added as tip). 
# The third line has an integer, taxPercent (the percentage of mealCost being added as tax).

# Output Format

# Print The total meal cost is totalCost dollars., where totalCost is the rounded integer result of the entire bill (mealCost with
# added tax and tip).
